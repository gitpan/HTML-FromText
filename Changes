2.01

  - Fixed URLS, they were broken because Regexp::Common::URI was much
    too restrictive (reported by Wim Kerkhoff).
  - Fixed bullets. Mixing '*' and '-' were previously allowed and caused
    problems. They can't be mixed within paragraphs that are bulleted
    lists any longer (reported by Wim Kerkhoff).
  - Fixed bold and underline, they were broken and matching, but not
    substituting, across line boundaries. They no longer match across
    line boundaries (reported by Wim Kerkhoff).
  - Fixed bold and underline, they were too greedy.  Now they require
    some non-word character before and after them (or the beginning or
    ending of a line). (reported by Wim Kerkhoff).
  - Nasty bug in lists where a nested list can cause an infinite loop
    when bullets don't line up quite right vertically (reported by Wim
    Kerkhoff).

2.00

  - Initial release as complete rewrite of version 1.005 by GDR.
  - Inadvertently created a new feature, nested bulleted and
    numbered lists.
